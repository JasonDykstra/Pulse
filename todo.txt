todo current commit:
-change fps to make it easily changeable

todo Colin:
-game states (waiting for Jason)
-air resistance

todo later:
-add air resistance
-make camera position itself based on where the lander is facing
-make asteroid sprites generate with the shape (Jason)
-fix collision detection
  -make rotational collisions and rotational energy with asteroids
  -fix lander-terrain collision detection (keep calculating torque and applying so it doesn't stick immediately; make lander rotate around vertex rather than around center; lander loses controls when it touches the ground)
  -do concave polygon collision detection (in progress but postponed)
-add game states (success/gameOver screen and 8 levels)
-increase fps to 60 or 120 and change numbers accurately
-telegraph if the lander is going to hit the ground at too high speed with speed lines like from anime and mariokart
-add sprites to bassWaves (need more art)
-make bullet firing charge up when you're not firing (nerf machine-gun firing and incentivize intentional aiming and firing at asteroids)
-make the display for fuel, ammo, and speed nice-looking

issues:
-gun too strong? stronger than thruster? needs playtesting
-asteroid generation based on Perlin sometimes has jagged cuts because of Perlin resetting
-bass waves go way too fast and are too large to avoid - need to playtest

ideas:
-something cool happens when you use fire from the thrusters on something else (like R.O.B.'s aerials in smash)
-have music from planet fade in as lander descends (start with lonely machinery beeping and fade in music as the planet and waves are visible)
-asteroids collide on the beat in the middle of the screen and explode?
-make terminal velocity for lander?
-make terrain red like mars (like Game Over drawing)
-make lander smaller (and change fire sprite to red)
-pick out a color scheme to design by
-make gravity increase as you approach the surface

wave naming convention:
-treble - small fast waves (blue, green, and red rectangular waves)
-bass - large slower waves (waves that radiate out)
-alto - atmospheric wind
-tenor - air geysers from surface of planet on beat (going up)
-soprano
-baritone
-subbass
