todo current commit:
-make music at different levels

art and design:
-planet pixel art
-new parallax star background art
-broken lander game over image when health == 0
-new title screen with pulse logo
-add sprites to bassWaves

todo upcoming:
-make music fade in as you approach the wave screen
-make the frequency diff logarithmic like human hearing
-peaks are relative to the whole songs' volume
-make the frequency median instead of average/mean
-make waves faster
-add sound effects
  -thruster fwooo
  -dash phooo
-level select gif
-art (above)

todo later:
-fix asteroid-lander collision detection (maybe adding random torque makes asteroid clip inside lander?)
-make camera position itself based on where the lander is facing
-fix collision detection
  -make rotational collisions and rotational energy with asteroids
  -fix lander-terrain collision detection (keep calculating torque and applying so it doesn't stick immediately; make lander rotate around vertex rather than around center; lander loses controls when it touches the ground)
  -do concave polygon collision detection (in progress but postponed)
-telegraph if the lander is going to hit the ground at too high speed with speed lines like from anime and mariokart
-make the display for fuel, ammo, and speed nice-looking

issues:
-gun too strong? stronger than thruster? needs playtesting
-asteroid generation based on Perlin sometimes has jagged cuts because of Perlin resetting
-bass waves go way too fast and are too large to avoid - need to playtest

ideas:
-make bullet firing charge up when you're not firing (nerf machine-gun firing and incentivize intentional aiming and firing at asteroids)
-something cool happens when you use fire from the thrusters on something else (like R.O.B.'s aerials in smash)
-have music from planet fade in as lander descends (start with lonely machinery beeping and fade in music as the planet and waves are visible)
-asteroids collide on the beat in the middle of the screen and explode?
-make terrain red like mars (like Game Over drawing)
-pick out a color scheme to design by
-maybe add "tutorial" or level 0 landing on some moon of the planet to touch down and learn the mechanics of maneuvering the probe and landing on terrain without disrupted by asteroids and waves

wave naming convention:
-treble - small fast waves (blue, green, and red rectangular waves)
-bass - large slower waves (waves that radiate out)
-alto - atmospheric wind
-tenor - air geysers from surface of planet on beat (going up)
-soprano
-baritone
-subbass
