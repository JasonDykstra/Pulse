todo:
-make terrain collision detection stop the lander
-make terrain collision detection with polygons to realistically bounce off the surface (one vertex after the other)
-make music interpretation
-make asteroids that physically crash against the lander (use conservation of momentum)
-add fuel gauge and other stats (how to do text in canvas?)
-add game states and title screen


-make all wave classes inherit properties and abstract methods from parent Wave class ? - need to research

issues:
-bass waves go way too fast and are too large to avoid - need to playtest

wave names:
-treble - small fast waves (blue, green, and red rectangular waves)
-bass - large slower waves (waves that radiate out)
-alto - wind?
-tenor
-soprano
-baritone
-subbass
