todo current commit:
-integrate asteroid game and wave game into one
  -when lander health == 0, lander stops working and explodes (gameOver)

art and design:
-asteroid pixel art
-planet pixel art
-new parallax star background art
-add sprites to bassWaves
-broken lander when health == 0

todo later:
-fix asteroid-lander collision detection (maybe adding random torque makes asteroid clip inside lander?)
-add more game states (level progression harder and harder, maybe upgrades?)
-make camera position itself based on where the lander is facing
-fix collision detection
  -make rotational collisions and rotational energy with asteroids
  -fix lander-terrain collision detection (keep calculating torque and applying so it doesn't stick immediately; make lander rotate around vertex rather than around center; lander loses controls when it touches the ground)
  -do concave polygon collision detection (in progress but postponed)
-telegraph if the lander is going to hit the ground at too high speed with speed lines like from anime and mariokart
-make bullet firing charge up when you're not firing (nerf machine-gun firing and incentivize intentional aiming and firing at asteroids)
-make the display for fuel, ammo, and speed nice-looking
-make animations able to loop a certain number of times


issues:
-need to separate lowpass filter source and actual audio to play
-gun too strong? stronger than thruster? needs playtesting
-asteroid generation based on Perlin sometimes has jagged cuts because of Perlin resetting
-bass waves go way too fast and are too large to avoid - need to playtest

ideas:
-make parallax scrolling with stars (smallest stars have low z-indexes)
-something cool happens when you use fire from the thrusters on something else (like R.O.B.'s aerials in smash)
-have music from planet fade in as lander descends (start with lonely machinery beeping and fade in music as the planet and waves are visible)
-asteroids collide on the beat in the middle of the screen and explode?
-make terrain red like mars (like Game Over drawing)
-pick out a color scheme to design by

wave naming convention:
-treble - small fast waves (blue, green, and red rectangular waves)
-bass - large slower waves (waves that radiate out)
-alto - atmospheric wind
-tenor - air geysers from surface of planet on beat (going up)
-soprano
-baritone
-subbass
