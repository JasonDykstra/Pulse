todo current:
-clean up code

todo later:
-make asteroid sprites generate with the shape
-do concave polygon collision detection
-fix lander-terrain collision detection (keep calculating torque and applying so it doesn't stick immediately; make lander rotate around vertex rather than around center; lander loses controls when it touches the ground)
-make rotational collisions and rotational energy with asteroids
-add game states and title screen
-increase fps to 60 or 120 and change numbers accurately
-add "game area" class to handle scrolling up and down (moving from asteroid phase to lander phase)
-add fuel gauge and other stats
-add sprites to bassWaves (need more art)
-make all wave classes inherit properties and abstract methods from parent Wave class ? - need to research

issues:
-bass waves go way too fast and are too large to avoid - need to playtest

random ideas:
-have music from planet fade in as lander descends (start with lonely machinery beeping and fade in music as the planet and waves are visible)
-asteroids collide on the beat in the middle of the screen and explode
-make terminal velocity for lander?

wave names:
-treble - small fast waves (blue, green, and red rectangular waves)
-bass - large slower waves (waves that radiate out)
-alto - wind?
-tenor
-soprano
-baritone
-subbass
